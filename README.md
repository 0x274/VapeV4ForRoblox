# Contributing
All contributions must be held to a certain standard of quality, mainly keeping the original code style in check.
1. Tab formatting
2. Unless its a return, please do not use 1 line for most function calls.
3. Localize variables when possible, most of the time the code should never have to index a variable, or call a function twice in a loop.

# Possible Issues
Half of the time its usually the scripting utility at fault, please make sure the utility meets certain quality standards such as.
1. Supporting file functions & the debug library.
2. Not implementing lua generated / half baked versions of such functions resulting in unintended behavior.
3. Maintaing the same behavior across all usages of said functions.
## User Issues
If its not the supposed utility at fault, please try some troubleshooting steps.
1. Deleting the newvape folder (WITH THE GAME CLOSED)
2. Making sure you have connection to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/7GrandDadPGN/VapeV4ForRoblox/refs/heads/main/NewMainScript.lua
3. Ensuring no external script is conflicting with vape
